## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct). By participating, you agree to uphold this code.

## Repository-Specific Guidelines

### Node Implementation

**IMPORTANT:** This code implements a Bitcoin node. Changes must:

1. **Maintain compatibility** with Bitcoin network
2. **Not break consensus** validation (use blvm-consensus for consensus changes)
3. **Handle network protocols** correctly
4. **Preserve data integrity**

### Additional Requirements

- **Consensus Integrity**: Never modify consensus rules (use blvm-consensus for that)
- **Production Readiness**: Consider production deployment implications
- **Performance**: Maintain reasonable performance characteristics
- **Test Coverage**: >85% for node-critical code

### Development Setup

**crates.io / CI (no monorepo path patches):** Like other `blvm-*` crates, `blvm-muhash` is declared as `>=0.1, <1`. The crates.io release you depend on must include the MuHash APIs this tree uses (`serialize_running_state` / `deserialize_running_state`, `insert_mut` / `remove_mut` on the IBD flush hot path). Publish [`blvm-muhash`](https://crates.io/crates/blvm-muhash) before or with any `blvm-node` release that needs newer APIs. Like a typical library crate, `Cargo.lock` is not committed (`Cargo.toml` semver pins are authoritative); CI resolves after stripping `[patch.crates-io]`, matching how dependents build.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BTCDecoded/blvm-node.git
cd blvm-node
cargo build
cargo test
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run with coverage
cargo tarpaulin --out Html --jobs 2

# Run specific test categories
cargo test --test integration_tests
cargo test --test storage_tests
```

### CI parity (default features)

This repo’s **CI** runs **`cargo test`** with **default** `[features].default` from `Cargo.toml` — not `--all-features`. For the same compile/link surface locally: **`cargo check -p blvm-node`**, then **`cargo test -p blvm-node --no-run`** (or **`cargo test`** to execute). If you touch optional features (`iroh`, `tidesdb`, etc.), add **`--features ...`** or **`--test <name>`** for those paths. **`cargo test --all-features`** is a separate, heavier matrix and is not what the main CI job runs.

### Review Criteria

Reviewers will check:

1. **Correctness** - Does the code work as intended?
2. **Node compatibility** - Does it maintain Bitcoin network compatibility?
3. **Test coverage** - Are all cases covered (>85%)?
4. **Performance** - No regressions?
5. **Documentation** - Is it clear and complete?
6. **Security** - Any potential vulnerabilities?

### Approval Process

- **At least 2 approvals** required for node-critical changes
- **Security team review** for network security changes
- **Performance review** for storage/network changes

## Getting Help

- **Documentation**: [docs.thebitcoincommons.org](https://docs.thebitcoincommons.org)
- **Issues**: Use GitHub issues for bugs and feature requests
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub discussions for questions
- **Security**: See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
