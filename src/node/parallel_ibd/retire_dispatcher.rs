//! Retire dispatcher: 1..N retire threads sharded by `height % N`.
//!
//! **Why this exists.** The original retire path was a single thread consuming an
//! `Arc<Mutex<BTreeMap<u64, Arc<UtxoDelta>>>>` plus an `mpsc::channel<IbdRetireWork>`.
//! Per-block bookkeeping (eviction, dynamic-protect, flush decisions) plus the periodic
//! flush trigger could not scale past one core, even though the underlying store, the
//! pending log, and the muhash accumulator all support concurrent updates.
//!
//! **Design.**
//! - `N` retire threads, each with its own `mpsc::channel<IbdRetireWork>`.
//! - Producer dispatches via [`RetireDispatcher::send`], which routes to shard
//!   `height % N`.
//! - Each shard tracks its own `local_last_retired` atomic; the public
//!   [`RetireDispatcher::global_last_retired`] is the **min** across all shards (the
//!   highest height that has been retired by *every* shard, the contiguously-retired
//!   floor). Logic that needs a contiguous floor reads `global_last_retired`.
//! - Flush packages are still spawned per-shard via the existing
//!   `push_utxo_flush_from_retire`. Workers populate the pending log independently of
//!   retire, so `take_flush_batch_through(local_h)` is safe to call concurrently from
//!   multiple shards: the only shared mutable state in the flush path is the `mh_acc`
//!   mutex (already serialized) and the `utxo_flush_handles` queue (already
//!   mutex-guarded).
//!
//! **Defaults.** [`configured_retire_shards`] returns `1` unless
//! `BLVM_IBD_RETIRE_SHARDS=N` is set with `N>=2`, which is byte-for-byte the original
//! single-threaded behavior. `>=2` opts into the sharded path; values larger than
//! `available_parallelism()/2` are clamped because each shard contends on `mem_mtx`
//! during the apply call. Practical sweet-spot is `2..=4` on most hosts.
//!
//! **Correctness invariants.**
//! 1. Workers push pending ops for height `h` *before* the dispatcher sends
//!    `IbdRetireWork{height=h}`. Therefore any shard calling
//!    `take_flush_batch_through(local_h)` only sees ops that workers already finished
//!    pushing — `local_h` may exceed `global_last_retired` without losing data.
//! 2. The chain UTXO watermark advances based on the per-flush-package
//!    `max_block_height`, not on `global_last_retired`. This means a fast shard's flush
//!    can advance the watermark past a slower shard's cursor; that is *correct* because
//!    the worker-side production is what the watermark actually depends on.
//! 3. `staged.remove(&h)` runs on the shard that owns `h` (per the modulo). No two
//!    shards ever touch the same staged entry.
//!
//! **Shutdown.** Dropping the dispatcher drops all senders, which causes each shard's
//! `mpsc::recv_timeout` to return `Disconnected` on the next tick and the thread to
//! exit cleanly. [`RetireDispatcher::shutdown_and_join`] waits for every shard.
